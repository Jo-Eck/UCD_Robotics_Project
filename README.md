# UCD Robotics Project

This Repo contains the code for the UCD Robotics Project of the [COMP20170: Introduction to Robotics](https://hub.ucd.ie/usis/!W_HU_MENU.P_PUBLISH?p_tag=MODULE&MODULE=COMP20170) course.

It is a joined effort of the following students:

- [Mynah Bhattacharyya](https://github.com/mynah-bird)
- [Luke Lynam](https://github.com/Wyvern42)
- [Adam Lacey](https://github.com/Ha7cher)
- [Jon Eckerth](https://github.com/Jo-Eck)
- [Ben McDowell](https://github.com/Benmc1)

## Project Description

The project is a robot which has to solve a series of challenges.

1. The robot will need to be able to navigate a course. The course will be a series of areas which the robot will need to navigate through.
   - The Dev-Log for this challenge can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BcbkquZ09W94oCHA4IotyMSPyje_6-qT3gi7uaeBphA/edit?usp=sharing)
2. During the Second challenge the robot will need to be go on a rescue mission. The robot will need to navigate to a location and then find a person. The robot will then need to find a way to get the person to a safe location, without entering any area marked as dangerous.
   - This Challenges dev-log can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qxz8Ch5i7K73d-4kluRbXO9T1niyn63iM9dFc-gz9ZE/edit?usp=sharing)
3. Our third challenge was to build and controll a robot arm utilizing rotational matrices. The robot is supposed to be able to pick up an object and place it in a specific location defined in cartesian coordinates. To do this it needs to be able to calculate the kinematic transformation between the base of the robot and the end effector.

4. The final challenge is to leave robotC behind us and getting familiar with the industry standard ROS. At first we simply write a publisher and subscriber nodes sending, recieving, processing and forwarding data.
